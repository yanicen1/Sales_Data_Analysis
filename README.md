## Sales Data Analysis

<b>Technical Task</b>

1. Calculate metrics using the following measures:
- Revenue
- Profit
- Profitability
- Active Client Base
- Average Order Value
- Logistics Costs

2. Create the following graphs:
- Metrics in a dynamic view
- Metrics by customer segment
- Metrics by product category, subcategory, and product name with drill-down capabilities
- Metrics with geographical distribution on a map

3. Perform an ABC analysis of items and present the results in a table.
  
4. Display a table listing managers who have generated negative profits and the number of orders with negative profits.


## Solution
The solution is available in the form of PowerBI dashboards within the [Project_1](https://github.com/yanicen1/Sales_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Project_(ABC_without_categories).pbix) file, where the ABC analysis of items is conducted without category segmentation, and Project_2, where the ABC analysis of items is conducted with category segmentation. You can view the dashboard layouts in this [PDF file](https://github.com/yanicen1/Sales_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Project_(ABC_without_categories).pdf). The data set is presented [here](https://github.com/yanicen1/Sales_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Dataset.xlsx).
